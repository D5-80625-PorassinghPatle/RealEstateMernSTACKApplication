## Project Overview

This project is a React application demonstrating the use of React Router for page navigation and user authentication, combined with a MongoDB backend.

## Prerequisites

Before running this application, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)

## Project Structure

The project structure is as follows:

- `src/`: Contains the source code for the React application.
    - `pages/`: Contains individual page components such as `Home.js`, `About.js`, `Profile.js`, `SignIn.js`, and `SignUp.js`.
    - `App.js`: Main component where routing is configured.
    - `redux/`: Contains Redux store, slices, and related files.
- `public/`: Contains static assets and the HTML file.
- `models/`: Contains Mongoose schemas and models for the backend.
- `utils/`: Contains utility functions for the backend.
- `firebase/`: Contains Firebase configuration and related files.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd project_name
    ```

3. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. Install backend dependencies (if using a backend):

    ```bash
    npm install express mongoose dotenv
    npm install bcryptjs jsonwebtoken
    ```

## Configuration

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project.

2. Add the following environment variables:

    ```plaintext
    MONGO=<your-mongodb-connection-string>
    JWT_SECRET=<your-jwt-secret>
    FIREBASE_CONFIG=<your-firebase-config>
    ```

## Development

To start the development server:

1. Start the React application:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

2. Open your browser and go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app.

## Backend

### Mongoose Schema and Model

In the backend, use Mongoose to define schemas and models for MongoDB collections:

- **`mongoose.Schema()`**: Defines the structure of a document (e.g., a user) in the MongoDB collection.
- **`mongoose.model()`**: Compiles the schema into a model, allowing you to create, read, update, and delete documents.

### User Authentication

User authentication is handled in the backend with the following packages:

- **`bcryptjs`**: For hashing passwords.
- **`jsonwebtoken`**: For generating and verifying JWT tokens.
- **`User`**: A Mongoose model representing user data.

#### Sign-Up Method

1. Extract `username`, `email`, and `password` from the request body (`req.body`).
2. Hash the password using `bcryptjs.hashSync` with a salt round of 10.
3. Create a new user instance with the hashed password.
4. Save the user to the database.
5. Send a success response if the user is saved successfully.

#### Sign-In Method

1. Extract `email` and `password` from the request body (`req.body`).
2. Find a user with the provided email.
3. Compare the provided password with the stored hashed password using `bcryptjs.compareSync`.
4. If passwords match, generate a JWT token using `jwt.sign` with the user's ID as the payload.
5. Set an HTTP-only cookie with the generated token.
6. Send the user's data (excluding the password) as a JSON response.

### JWT Secret

The `JWT_SECRET` environment variable is crucial for signing and verifying JSON Web Tokens (JWTs):

- Used to sign tokens with `jwt.sign`.
- Enables the server to verify the authenticity of tokens with `jwt.verify`.
- Should be stored securely in an environment variable.

## Sign-Up and Sign-In Components

- The `SignUp` and `SignIn` components provide forms for user registration and authentication.
- These components handle form data using the `useState` hook and manage form submission asynchronously with the `fetch` API.

## Proxy Configuration

Vite provides proxy configuration for API requests during development:

- In `vite.config.js`, set up a proxy for the development server.
- Example:

    ```javascript
    import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
    import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react-swc';

    export default defineConfig({
        plugins: [react()],
        server: {
            proxy: {
                '/api': {
                    target: 'http://localhost:3000',
                    secure: false,
                },
            },
        },
    });
    ```

This proxy configuration allows your frontend application to make API requests to a backend server running on `http://localhost:3000/api` during development, avoiding cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) issues.

## Redux and Redux Persist

### Redux Toolkit

- **Redux Toolkit (`@reduxjs/toolkit`)**: This package provides tools to work with Redux more efficiently, including the `configureStore` function for creating a Redux store and `createSlice` function for creating reducers and actions.

- **`configureStore`**: This function creates a Redux store. The store holds the state of your application and allows you to manage state more efficiently.

- **`createSlice`**: This function creates a slice of state, which includes the initial state, reducers, and the slice's name.

- **Reducers**: A slice defines reducers (functions) that handle actions to update the state. In your code:
    - `signInStart` sets the loading state to true.
    - `signInSuccess` updates the current user and sets the loading state to false and error to null.
    - `signInFailure` sets the error state and the loading state to false.

- **Actions**: Redux Toolkit automatically generates action creators from the reducers. The actions are exported (`signInStart`, `signInSuccess`, `signInFailure`) for use in the component.

- **`useSelector`**: This hook is used to access the current state from the Redux store.

- **`useDispatch`**: This hook provides access to the Redux store's dispatch function.

### Redux Persist

- **`redux-persist`**: This is an npm package that works with Redux to persist the Redux store's state in a specified storage, such as `localStorage`.

- **`combineReducers`**: Combines the reducers from different parts of the application into a single root reducer (`rootReducer`).

- **`persistConfig`**: Configures how Redux Persist will handle persistence. The `key` property specifies the key under which the Redux state will be stored, and the `storage` property specifies the storage medium (`localStorage`).

- **`persistReducer`**: Wraps the root reducer with persistence logic using the configuration object (`persistConfig`).

- **`persistStore`**: Creates a persistor object based on the Redux store. The persistor object manages the persistence logic for the Redux store.

- **`Provider` and `PersistGate`**: In `main.jsx`, these components wrap the application with a Redux store provider and a persistence gate, ensuring the app has access to the Redux store and persistence is properly managed.

## Google Authentication with Firebase

### Initialization

- **Firebase App**: The Firebase app needs to be initialized with your Firebase project's configuration (`app`). This is typically done in a separate file, where you import the Firebase modules and initialize the app with your project's configuration.

- **Firebase Auth**: Create an instance of `auth` using `getAuth(app)`. This instance is used to manage authentication tasks like signing in, signing out, and checking authentication status.

### Google Auth Provider

- **`GoogleAuthProvider`**: This is a class provided by Firebase Authentication to handle Google sign-in. It manages the integration with Google as an identity provider and simplifies the authentication process.

### Sign-In with Popup

- **Functionality**: The function `signInWithPopup` allows you to sign in a user using a popup window. It takes the `auth` instance and the Google auth provider as arguments.

- **Process**:
    - When called, it opens a popup window for the user to sign in with their Google account.
    - Once the user

 successfully signs in and grants necessary permissions, Firebase Auth receives the authentication result.
    - The result includes the user's credentials and profile information (`result.user`).

### Handling Authentication Result

- **User Information**: Once the authentication result is received, you can access the user's profile information (`result.user.displayName`, `result.user.email`, `result.user.photoURL`) from the `result` object.

- **Sending User Data**: The user's information is then sent to the backend (`/api/auth/google`) as a POST request. This allows the backend to handle authentication and user data as needed (e.g., creating a new user if they don't exist in the database).

### Error Handling

- **Try-Catch Block**: The code uses a try-catch block to handle potential errors during the authentication process.

- **Error Handling**: If an error occurs during authentication (e.g., network issues, user cancels the popup), the catch block logs the error.

## Summary

The guide covers the setup of a React Vite application with user authentication and authorization using a MongoDB backend, Redux state management, Redux Persist for data persistence, and Firebase Authentication for Google sign-in. The guide provides a structured approach to building a modern web application with these technologies, ensuring security and efficiency in handling user data and state management.
