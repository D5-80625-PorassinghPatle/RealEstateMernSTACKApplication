Mongoose Schema and Model

mongoose.Schema(): Defines the structure of a document (in this case, a user) in the MongoDB collection. It specifies the fields, their types, and any additional options such as validation rules or default values.

mongoose.model(): Compiles the schema into a model. Models are constructors created from schemas, allowing you to create, read, update, and delete documents in the MongoDB collection associated with the model.
